# Welcome to Decrypt It!
_decryptit.py_

This game improves your cryptographic and pattern recognition skills.

You will be given a message "encrypted" in a simple "cipher".
The "ciphers" are: Caesar Shift, Ascii Shift, Scramble (whole or by-word), and reverse.

Your task is to decrypt the message, case sensitive.
All messages are grammatically correct and they all make sense. Most of them have valid words; some don't.

You have an infinite number of attempts. However, each attempt will be scored.
Every correct submission is +1 point. Every incorrect submission is 0 points. Every skipped submission is -1 points.
Enter a blank line to skip.

Note: Most messages end and begin with a non-space character. Spaces at the end and beginning of your submission will be ignored.

Good luck!
